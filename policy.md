# Terms of Service + Privacy Policy

We frown upon manipulative tactics hidden inside legal jargon, so we choose not to do so, and because we also respect your time, we made a simple, human readable document. It should take 2-3 minutes to read or terms of service and privacy policy.

# Privacy Policy

**Third parties who collect data:** fontawsome and Bootstrap are used in our website to provide _icons and buttons_, both companies share the same [privacy policy](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/privacy-policy/), they collect analytics to determine what icons are the most popular.

**How to opt out of third party data collection:** since the icons are not necessary to use our website you can block them without losing any functionality, to block them use [noscript](https://github.com/hackademix/noscript/) or [ublock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) origin. Alternatively we provide a light version of our website that does not use fontawsome or Bootstrap whatsoever: [digital-rights.github.io/light](https://digital-rights.github.io/light/).
